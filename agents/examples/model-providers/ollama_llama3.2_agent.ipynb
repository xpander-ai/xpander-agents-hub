      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why the sky typically appears blue during the daytime, especially in the direction of the sun. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: Sunlight, which contains all the colors of the visible spectrum, enters Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "2. **Scattering by molecules**: The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases, such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), in the atmosphere.\n",
      "3. **Rayleigh scattering**: These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter wavelengths more than longer wavelengths. This is because smaller molecules are more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "4. **Blue light dominates**: As a result of Rayleigh scattering, blue light is scattered more than any other color, making it the dominant wavelength in the sky.\n",
      "5. **Our eyes perceive the blue**: When we look up at the sky, our eyes detect the scattered blue light and interpret it as the color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this phenomenon only occurs when the sun is overhead or in a position above the horizon, resulting in a bright blue sky during the daytime. At sunrise and sunset, the sky often appears more red or orange due to other atmospheric effects, such as scattering by dust particles and water vapor.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: the sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, which scatters shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n"
