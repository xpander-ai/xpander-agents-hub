## üöÄ Quick Start

This guide will help you set up and run the Meeting Recorder Agent. For a comprehensive introduction to building agents with xpander.ai, check out the [Quickstart Workbench Guide](https://docs.xpander.ai/docs/01-get-started/02-getting-started-01-workbench).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Meet account
- [xpander.ai](https://xpander.ai) account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-agents-hub
cd xpander-agents-hub/Solutions/meeting-recorder-agent

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Your Agent

You have two options to set up the agent on xpander.ai:

#### Option 1: Use the Template (Recommended)

1. Log in to your [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) account
2. Inside "Agents" Click on Templates and select "Meeting Recorder Template"
3. Click "Import Template" to add it to your workspace
4. Once imported, from the AI Agent Workbench, click on the SDK Trigger
5. Copy your **Agent ID** and **API Key**

Learn more about getting started with xpander workbench in the [official documentation](https://docs.xpander.ai/docs/01-get-started/02-getting-started-01-workbench).

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to build the agent manually:

1. Log in to your [app.xpander.ai](https://xpander.ai) account
2. Click "Create New Agent" from your dashboard and skip the Planner step
3. Add the following tools to your agent from the Built-in actions menu:
   - **Check Recorder Status** tool
   - **Create Meeting Recording Bot** tool
   - **Send Email with Content** tool
4. Add the following tool to your agent from the Google Calendar app:
   - **Get Calendar Events by ID** tool
5. Save your agent and copy your **Agent ID** and **API Key** from the SDK Trigger

For detailed instructions on adding tools to your agent, refer to the [Adding Tools to Agents](https://docs.xpander.ai/docs/02-agent-builder/02-add-tools-to-agents) documentation.

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
XPANDER_API_KEY=your_xpander_key
XPANDER_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

## üìö How It Works

The agent uses two main components:

1. **Main App (`app.py`)**: Coordinates everything and schedules checks every 5 minutes
2. **Meeting Agent (`meeting_agent.py`)**: Connects to xpander.ai to run the agent

The agent leverages xpander.ai's built-in thread-based memory system to maintain conversation context and remember meeting details across sessions.

## üîç Usage

### Basic Commands

Check all your recorded meetings (you will get 404 error here on the first run, because you didn't record anything yet)

```bash
python app.py
```

Record a specific meeting:

```bash
python app.py "please record meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
```

Check your calendar:

```bash
python app.py "what's on my calendar"
```

### Thread Management

Continue the previous conversation (default behavior):

```bash
# This will use the existing thread_id.txt file
python app.py "what's the status of my recordings?"
```

Start a completely new conversation thread:

```bash
# This will ask for confirmation if an existing thread is found
python app.py --new-thread "please record a new meeting"
```

### Example Workflow

1. **First run** - Record a meeting:
   ```bash
   python app.py "record meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
   # This creates a new thread and stores its ID
   ```

2. **Later run** - Check recording status:
   ```bash
   python app.py "how's my recording going?"
   # This continues the same thread, so the agent remembers the meeting
   ```

3. **Optional reset** - Start fresh:
   ```bash
   python app.py --new-thread "let's start tracking a different set of meetings"
   # This creates a new thread with no memory of previous meetings
   ```

The agent will automatically:
- Create a new thread if none exists
- Continue with the existing thread when available
- Ask for confirmation before overriding an existing thread

## üíæ Thread-Based Memory System

The agent uses xpander.ai's thread-based memory system instead of storing meeting data locally. Here's how it works:

### How Threads Work
- Each **thread** represents an ongoing conversation about meetings
- The agent remembers all context within a thread, including:
  - Meeting URLs you've shared
  - Recording bot IDs and statuses
  - Previous requests and interactions

### Thread Management
The application handles threads intelligently:

1. **First Run**: Creates a new thread automatically and saves its ID to `thread_id.txt`
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Loads the existing thread ID to continue the same conversation
3. **With `--new-thread` Flag**: 
   - If a thread already exists, asks for confirmation before replacing it
   - If confirmed, creates a fresh thread with no previous context

This approach provides several benefits:
- **Persistent Memory**: The agent remembers all previous meetings across sessions
- **Seamless Continuity**: Pick up conversations exactly where you left off
- **Simple Storage**: Only the thread ID needs to be stored locally
- **Clean Reset Option**: Start fresh when needed with the `--new-thread` flag

For example, if you record a meeting in one session, you can ask about its status in a later session, and the agent will remember all the details as long as you're using the same thread.

## üìä Example Output

When you run the agent asking about calendar events:

```bash
python app.py "what's on my calendar"
```

It responds with:

```
Here are the events on your calendar and the status of the recording bots:
